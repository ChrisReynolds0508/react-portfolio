# react-portfolio

## Description
This is the first draft of my React portfolio website.  This was my first time using React and I am looking forward to learning a lot more about its functionality.  
I have created this portfolio to showcase some of my coding bootcamp projects and give myself a staging area to post future projects I will complete to show potential employers in the future.
